# MissileDefense

Missile Defense is a game modeled after missile command, an Atari game. Defend your city against incoming missiles, or perish. In addition to the normal defensive missile mechanics, players will have the option of unleashing a missile barrage, which will shoot up a barrage of missiles that will clear the incoming missiles.
